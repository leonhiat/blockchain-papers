Thanks for contributing!

To add a new link:

 * Make sure it doesn't already exist.
 * Link to PDF is required. Open knowledge is mandatory. Papers where the PDF
   is not publicly and openly available for free will not be accepted.
 * Must be a proper paper. Not a deck of slides, not a document lacking an
   abstract, not a blog post, not a bitcoin forum post.
 * Self-published papers outside the academic community are OK, but they must
   make significant contributions (e.g. Nakamoto's original paper).
   Peer-reviewed papers are preferred.
 * Authors must be named in a Vancouver-style citation.
 * Conference or journal and year must be stated if available.

This is a curated list of *blockchain*-related papers, not general cryptography
or distributed systems. Blockchains are "chains of blocks", not general-purpose
distributed computing mechanisms. This is a list for permiossionless
blockchain papers. "Permissioned blockchains" are not blockchains because they
do not require chains of blocks for their security guarantees; they are
byzantine-agreement-related bibliography and do not fit into this list. Please
stay on topic!
